Project Definition:

- This is a registration app specifically used by a sports team or a school club/group. 
- The user clicks a drop down and selects their organization.
- The next page will then display what teams or clubs are available for that organization.
- They select which team or club they are registering for.
- Then a multi-page form will appear for that team/club.
- The user fills out the form with their info.
- The user clicks submit.
- IF TIME ALLOWS (or in a future class): An admin can see who has registered for each team, and can mark them accepted or declined.
