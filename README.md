Project Definition:

This is a registration app specifically used by a sports team or a school club/group. 
The user clicks a drop down and selects their organization.
The next page will then display what teams or clubs are available for that organization.
They select which team or club they are registering for.
Then a multi-page form will appear for that team/club.
The user fills out the form with their info.
The user clicks submit.
IF TIME ALLOWS (or in a future class): An admin can see who has registered for each team, and can mark them accepted or declined.
